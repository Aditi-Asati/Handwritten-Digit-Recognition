# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
We adopt Logistic Regression Model which is a classification algorithm to recognise digits manually written by high school students and the employees of the US Census Bureau. We train the model on 60,000 small images each of 28x28 pixels where all the images are labelled with the respective digit they represent.The dataset has 784 features and each feature simply represents one pixel's intensity,from 0(white) to 255(black).
We also create a "5" digit Detector which essentially deduces whether a digit is 5 or not with an accuracy of 97.31%, again using Logistic Regression.
